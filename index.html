         We are an interdisciplinary team of researchers, data scientists, designers and developers working on digital systems to facilitate the transformation of information to knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
         We make interactions between a multitude of actors in the knowledge sphere more accessible, transparent and tangible.

            As research into the novel Coronavirus is surging, maintaining oversight over the current state of insight becomes more and more challenging with every new research paper produced and published.
          </p>
          <p>
            With the aim of making existing and future research on COVID-19 more accessible, metasphere is developing a platform with two primary tools: a knowledge map and an analysis tool. The knowledge map allows to visually navigate clusters of the research landscape and the analysis tool facilitates collaboration on the growing corpus of literature.
          </p>
          <p>
            Kick-started as part of the ⟶ <a href="https://hackcorona.world/" target="_blank">#hackcorona</a> hackathon, the efforts are now carried on by an international group of collaborators committed to introduce the first iteration of the platform as soon as possible.

          The aim of our projects is to represent reality in ways that offer high resolution in terms of details while maintaining, to the extent possible, the complex nature of reality.

          We are working on devising an approach and ultimately tools to <strong> a) allow for the preservation of complexity</strong> and <strong>b) make visible and thereby explorable the complex nature of information attributes</strong>. These two elements are vastly important to allow for the ability to follow trails of thoughts and also for the replicability of ideas and transparency of produced knowledge.
        </p>
        <p>
          The approach is informed by early research by hypertext pioneers such as Theodor Nelson or Vannevar Bush and focuses more on the question of how to allow for the preservation of complexity by <strong> leveraging the benefits of visual and navigational metaphors borrowed from representations of the physical spaces</strong>  – like maps (with the benefits of zooming, exploration of trails, etc.) to represent networked information, clusters to account for topical overlaps or gravity to visualize influence or attraction.
